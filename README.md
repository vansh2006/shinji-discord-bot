Discord Bot Used for my class of 24' high school classmates (group of 150 members) used for keeping track of deadlines and assignments, many fun activity features, and functional reminders.
(Inactive after 2022)

Requires Discord provided bot token to use on servers

The /cogs contain each of the activity features that could be used in chat, main.py and shinji.py contain the functional school related functions
